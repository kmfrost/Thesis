The algorithm might be interesting to use.  It calculates the entropy of nodes in the graph and recalculates the entropy leaving each node out.  They use this to come up with a metric for importance in the graph: "the node whose absence brings maximum change in graph entropy is the most influential node in the graph."
Used the Enron dataset. (these were the guys who cleaned the dataset up)

	abstract = {We describe a methodology for the automatic identification of communities of practice from email logs within an organization. We use a betweeness centrality algorithm that can rapidly find communities within a graph representing information flows. We apply this algorithm to an email corpus of nearly one million messages collected over a two-month span, and show that the method is effective at identifying true communities, both formal and informal, within these scale-free graphs. This approach also enables the identification of leadership roles within the communities. These studies are complemented by a qualitative evaluation of the results in the field.},

It's called the Girvan-Newman algorithm in the paper by Tang, et al.
Definitely an example of trying to solve the same problem purely from a graph theoretical approach.
Might be cool to try to replicate some of this on our data.
Some interesting thoughts in the applications and limitations sections.
Future work: Add temporal classification ("monday morning" communities, change over time)},

	abstract = {We introduce a new centrality measure that characterizes the participation of each node in all subgraphs in a network. Smaller subgraphs are given more weight than larger ones, which makes this measure appropriate for characterizing network motifs. We show that the subgraph centrality (SC) can be obtained mathematically from the spectra of the adjacency matrix of the network. This measure is better able to discriminate the nodes of a network than alternate measures such as degree, closeness, betweenness and eigenvector centralities. We study eight real-world networks for which SC displays useful and desirable properties, such as clear ranking of nodes and scale-free characteristics. Compared with the number of links per node, the ranking introduced by SC (for the nodes in the protein interaction network of S. cereviciae) is more highly correlated with the lethality of individual proteins removed from the proteome.},

	Interesting that they only considered emails that were clearly before the scandal - they were only interested in normal company business.  Describes how they categorized employees, but I'm still confused about how they labeled Analysts and Specialists.  And I'm not sure if administrative assistants should be at the bottom of the totem pole  - I feel like they'd often be sending emails way up the chain of command,},
