Short documents don't contain enough text to compute similarities accurately by implementing the most widely used technique called Vector Space Model (VSM). Adding semantics to short documents clustering is one efficient way to solve this problem. However, real life collections are often composed of very short or long documents. For example, the length of email messages for each email user follows a power-law distribution. Long emails and short emails both appear in email corpus. Therefore, both state-of-the-art short documents and long document clustering approaches can't get a high cluster quality or high efficiency in short and long documents clustering. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel approach for email clustering based on semantics. Empirical validation shows that our method can obtain high cluster quality and high efficiency in real world email datasets.},

However, missing desired recipients for sent messages that frequently happens results in great communication confusion and collaboration inefficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective Email recipient recommendation service implemented by the participant co-occurrence social network based method to help Email users find the missing recipients. Given a specific task of recommending recipient we studied three key factors based on the social network: 1) a general recipient recommendation algorithm based on the social network; 2) the method for updating the edge weight of the social network for the new query (message); and 3) the method to measure the correlated vertices by the social metric of closeness centrality. An extensive evaluation has been conducted on the Enron Email Corpus and Lotus Notes Email Corpus. Experimental results show that the proposed method with a proper estimation of edges and vertices in the social network can achieve significant performance improvement for finding the missing recipients. Five real missing cases of Enron Email Corpus further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Besides, we implemented the service in IBM Lotus Notes and invited dozens of colleagues to join in a pilot. The initial feedbacks received from participants are very positive.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new centrality measure that characterizes the participation of each node in all subgraphs in a network. Smaller subgraphs are given more weight than larger ones, which makes this measure appropriate for characterizing network motifs. We show that the subgraph centrality (SC) can be obtained mathematically from the spectra of the adjacency matrix of the network. This measure is better able to discriminate the nodes of a network than alternate measures such as degree, closeness, betweenness and eigenvector centralities. We study eight real-world networks for which SC displays useful and desirable properties, such as clear ranking of nodes and scale-free characteristics. Compared with the number of links per node, the ranking introduced by SC (for the nodes in the protein interaction network of S. cereviciae) is more highly correlated with the lethality of individual proteins removed from the proteome.},
