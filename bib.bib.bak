Short documents don't contain enough text to compute similarities accurately by implementing the most widely used technique called Vector Space Model (VSM). Adding semantics to short documents clustering is one efficient way to solve this problem. However, real life collections are often composed of very short or long documents. For example, the length of email messages for each email user follows a power-law distribution. Long emails and short emails both appear in email corpus. Therefore, both state-of-the-art short documents and long document clustering approaches can't get a high cluster quality or high efficiency in short and long documents clustering. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel approach for email clustering based on semantics. Empirical validation shows that our method can obtain high cluster quality and high efficiency in real world email datasets.},

Spammers, however, can bypass these methods easily-especially the ones that deal with header features. In this paper, we report a novel spam classification method that uses features based on email content-language and readability combined with the previously used content-based task features. The features are extracted from four benchmark datasets viz. CSDMC2010, Spam Assassin, Ling Spam, and Enron-Spam. We use five well-known algorithms to induce our spam classifiers: Random Forest (RF), BAGGING, ADABOOSTM1, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naïve Bayes (NB). We evaluate the classifier performances and find that BAGGING performs the best. Moreover, its performance surpasses that of a number of state-of-the-art methods proposed in previous studies. Although applied only to English language emails, the results indicate that our method may be an excellent means to classify spam emails in other languages, as well.},

	abstract = {Email is one of the most essential IT services for modern enterprises. However, missing desired recipients for sent messages that frequently happens results in great communication confusion and collaboration inefficiency. In this paper, we propose an effective Email recipient recommendation service implemented by the participant co-occurrence social network based method to help Email users find the missing recipients. Given a specific task of recommending recipient we studied three key factors based on the social network: 1) a general recipient recommendation algorithm based on the social network; 2) the method for updating the edge weight of the social network for the new query (message); and 3) the method to measure the correlated vertices by the social metric of closeness centrality. An extensive evaluation has been conducted on the Enron Email Corpus and Lotus Notes Email Corpus. Experimental results show that the proposed method with a proper estimation of edges and vertices in the social network can achieve significant performance improvement for finding the missing recipients. Five real missing cases of Enron Email Corpus further verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Besides, we implemented the service in IBM Lotus Notes and invited dozens of colleagues to join in a pilot. The initial feedbacks received from participants are very positive.},

	abstract = {Big data analytics sifts through mountains of data to identify or predict facts about individuals and to use those facts in decisions ranging from which products to sell them to whether to provide them medical treatment. Given the present state of technology, there are risks associated with big data analytics: source data may be misunderstood or contain errors and analytics processes may introduce new errors or be less exact than intended. Data protection and the application of principles of fair information practices promote the responsible management and use of information about individuals and guard against risks that data and its use may raise. Given the potential harm to individuals—from the denial of credit or care to the elimination of educational opportunities—we addresses the corporate, social, and ethical responsibility to engage the appropriate professionals in making decisions to use the resulting predictions as well as the responsibility to implement a robust risk management process.},
